## How does it work
UI elements are usually displayed orthogonally, so it is impossible to create a parallax effect by moving and rotating the camera. However, no one is stopping us from moving and rotating UI objects in such a way as if the camera were moving, not the objects. Such a movement of UI objects gives a very realistic parallax effect.

> The library uses an accelerometer, not a gyroscope, because an accelerometer is present on more devices than a gyroscope.

## How to use this library
**Firstly**, you need to add component of the parallax effect on the scene - the `UIParallaxEffect` script. It contains a set of `UIParallaxLayer` objects, which is an array of different UI elements with its parallax settings.

**Important!** Component `UIParallaxEffect` initialize and update automatically. If you want control `UIParallaxEffect` by yourself, than set parametre  `AutoUpdate` to false and call methods `Initialize()` and `RefreshParallaxEffect()` in outer scripts.

**Secondly**, you must define each `UIParallaxLayer` in the `UIParallaxEffect` component. `UIParallaxLayer` has several parameters that will be described below.

## Parameters UIParallaxLayer
* ***ParallaxLayerName*** - layer name (for ease of display)
* ***ObjectsRect*** - array of RectTransform objects that belong to this layer
* ***PosXMultiplier*** - the value at which the X position in the anchoredPosition of the objects changes
* ***PosYMultiplier*** - the value at which the Y position in the anchoredPosition of the objects changes
* ***InterpolationSpeed*** - parallax speed, in other words, the speed at which layer objects move and rotate

## How to install?
1. Download `UIParallaxEffect.unitypackage` and using UnityPackageManager.
2. The Unity Package Manager (UPM) is a new method to manage external packages. It keeps package contents separate from your main project files.

Modify your project's Packages/manifest.json file adding this line:
```"com.lodza.uiparallax": "https://github.com/RodionLodza/UIParallaxLibary.git#package-branch"```

To access classes inside of this package you will need to add a reference to com.lodza.fastpool.asmdef to your project's assembly definition file.
